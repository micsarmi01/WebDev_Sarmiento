        <h1>What is the Spiral Software Development Methodology?</h1>
        <p class="maintext"> Spiral Methodology uses concepts from the prototyping methodology, this means that in the process of completeing the project
            several prototypes may be developed. Input from the client is taken after 2 or 3 prototype iterations. Decisions are also made based on risk,
     . Those risks included time, money, and resrouces. Prototypes can be scrapped if any of those risks are identified.

        <h3 class="positive">Here are some key features that make the Sprial Process a good choice</h3>
    
   
      <ul>
          

        <li> <span class="positivelistStyle">Proto-typing</span> – Find new ways to use items instead of throwing them away!</li>
        <li> <span class="positivelistStyle">Risk Assesment </span> – Separate the items you are disposing of (plastic, paper, glass, organic)</li>
        <li> <span class="positivelistStyle">Client Input </span> – The best way to prevent pollution is not using materials that cause pollution: bring your own bags to the grocery store, ride a bike, turn off the lights!</li>

       </ul>  
        
        <h3 class="negative"> Here are some negative features of the Spiral Process</h3>
    
   
      <ul>
          

        <li> <span class="negativelistStyle">Requires risk assesment skill </span> – Finding people to higher with the ability for risk assesment is difficult and costly as it is a desireable skill.</li>
        <li> <span class="negativelistStyle"> Not Good for small projects </span> – This method may not be the best choice for smaller projects because of the heavy analysis of risk which, it may be more effecient to discover the risk through the iterative process for smaller projects.</li>
        <li> <span class="negativelistStyle">Can be costly</span> –  The cost of Spiral model can be excessive, this is because the required skills for risk assesment can be costly to hire. Also the possiblity of prototypes
          being scrapped and starting from scratch adds to the possibility of high cost </li>

       </ul>
