        <h1>What is the Waterfall Software Development Methodology?</h1>
        <p class="maintext"> Waterfall methodology is the choice for large projects that require a near perfect product delivery first try. Waterfall
            produces well documented, analyzed, and researched products. The thoroughness of the waterfall methodology can often be time and resource consuming. The process is great for projects like medical devices
            or construction projects that require the final product to work without fault. Waterfall methodology does not work well with change and adaptation, in many cases
            clients dont know what they know right away.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3 class="positive">Here are some key features that make the Waterfall process a good choice</h3>
    
   
      <ul>
          

        <li> <span class="positivelistStyle">Thoroughness in Research, Documentation, and Analysis </span> – This is highly desirable in an industry with poor documentation </li>
        <li> <span class="positivelistStyle">Capable of product being delivered as desired </span> – Thoroughness can produce a near perfect delivery </li>
        <li> <span class="positivelistStyle">Best choice method for Medical and construction </span> – Near perfect delivery makes it the best choice for projects that can not fail like life saving medical devices</li>

       </ul>  
        
        <h3 class="negative"> Here are some negative features of the Waterfall process</h3>
    
   
      <ul>
          

        <li> <span class="negativelistStyle">Time Consuming </span> – Thoroughness will take up time and resources</li>
        <li> <span class="negativelistStyle">Change not welcome </span> – Waterfall methodology is inflexible and does not tolerate change </li>
        <li> <span class="negativelistStyle">Little to no feedback </span> – Feedback is not received until the end of the process, client interaction is also very limited </li>

       </ul>
