        <h1>What is the Software Development Life Cycle?</h1>
        <p> The Software Development Life Cycle is a term used to reference the process of
            project and time management in the development of software or products.  
            The software development life cycle uses several stages that build up to the
            completion of the objective. SDLC is an umbrella term for various methodologies 
            in the format of using phases to work towards completing the objective. 
            This web page will describe 3 methodologies of SDLC and
            also provide pros and cons to each of those methodologies. 
        </p>

        <h3>There are 3 Software development lifecycle methologies and approaches that this webpage will cover</h3>
    
   
      <ul>
          

        <li> <span class="listStyle">Agile </span> – Change is expected, large project broken into little tasks, many itterations.</li>
        <li> <span class="listStyle">Spiral </span> – A mix of proto-typing and waterfall, some iterations and broken down tasks but also heavy planning and documentation. </li>
        <li> <span class="listStyle">Waterfall </span> – Some critisize as the slowest SDLC Methodology, good for projects that must work first iteration on market. </li>

       </ul>  
        
        <h3>There are more methodologies that you can research about</h3>
    
   
      <ul>
          

        <li> <span class="secondlistStyle">Iterative </span> – Large project broken into small projects, you learn what needs to be changed or added as you go. </li>
        <li> <span class="secondlistStyle">SCRUM </span> – Many small teams with many tasks, frequent meetings on progress, everyone works toward one goal. </li>
        <li> <span class="secondlistStyle">ProtoTyping </span> – Many iterations of a completed product, building upon a developed prototype.  </li>

       </ul>
